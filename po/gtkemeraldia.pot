"Drop the blocks.  If you drop a square on top of one of the same color, they "
"(as well as any neighboring blocks of the same color) will both be shaken by "
"an “impact”.  The first impact will cause fractures; the second will cause "
"the block(s) to dissolve.\n"
"\n"
"You can either use the arrow keys or vi-style (hjkl) keys to move/rotate the "
"blocks.  “s” or “p” will pause the game, and if your boss comes along, “q” "
"can be used to avoid an unpleasant confrontation.\n"
